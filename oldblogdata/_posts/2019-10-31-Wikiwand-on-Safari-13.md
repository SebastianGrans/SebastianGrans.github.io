</center>If you use [AdGuard for Safari](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/adguard-for-safari/id1440147259?mt=12) as your ad blocker, add the filter to the "User filter" to redirect any Wikipedia article to Wikiwand.

**TL;DR** If you use [AdGuard for Safari](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/adguard-for-safari/id1440147259?mt=12) as your ad blocker, add the filter to the "User filter" to redirect any Wikipedia article to Wikiwand.

**Update:** For some reason, it has stopped working on my MacBook that runs Catalina. It still runs on another MacBook running Mojave. I'll look into it some day.

**Update 2:** I have now updated the rule so that it works again! There's a bug in the AdGuard Base filter. [Link to issue](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/79855)

As of Safari 13, only extensions from the App Store can be used. 
This killed a lot of extensions, including Wikiwand. However, we can get the main functionality back using another approach. 

In order for me to stay sane on the web today, I need to have an ad blocker (I hope for your sanity that you use one too). Since Safari 13 was launched, [AdGuard for Safari](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/adguard-for-safari/id1440147259?mt=12) was the only ad blocker I found that worked well (e.g. it blocked YouTube ads). AdGuard allows you to add user defined filters, and the syntax is explained [here](https://kb.adguard.com/en/general/how-to-create-your-own-ad-filters#javascript-rules). 

> (Please note that AdGuard for Safari â‰  AdGuard for Mac. The latter blocks Ads for any application on your compouter. However, it also costs money. This "tutorial" uses the former and I have no idea if the same would work for the latter.) 

With the filter syntax documentation, and some very basic JavaScript we can create this filter: 

```javascript
@@||wikipedia.org^$generichide,badfilter
wikipedia.org#%#if (window.location.search === "") { var lang = window.location.hostname.split('.')[0]; var article = window.location.pathname.split('/')[2]; window.location.href = "http://www.wikiwand.com/" + lang + "/" + article; } 
```

Add this, as a single line, to your user filters in AdGuard and any time you visit a Wikipedia article, you will be redirected to Wikiwand. 

I hope this helps someone :)  

**Enjoy!**


P.s. if the URL has any kind of query string (e.g. `?query=test`),  you will not be redirected. This is so that you can still read on the original Wikipedia when you press the "Read on Wikipedia"-button in Wikiwand. Because that appends `?oldformat=true`.

P.s.s. Expand the spoiler to see a explanation of the code.
<details markdown="1">
<summary><h3 style="display: inline">Explanation of the code</h3></summary>
Let's assume we visit "[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikiwand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikiwand)"

The first part of the line, `wikipedia.org`, tells AdGuard to trigger the filter. `#%#` tells AdGuard that it should perform a JavaScript injection.
Anything after that should be JavaScript code.

Here is the code in a more readable form:
```javascript
// If we do not have any query string appended (i.e. not ?oldformat=true), 
// then  we should redirect to Wikiwand.
if (window.location.search === "") {  
  
	// This takes the domain: "en.wikipedia.org", splits it at each period into 
	// ["en", "wikipedia", "org"].
	// We then get the zeroth element, i.e. which language we are reading in. 
	var lang = window.location.hostname.split('.')[0];

	// Similarly, we get the path e.g. "/wiki/wikiwand"
	var article = window.location.pathname.split('/')[2]; 
    
 // Then we construct and set the new window location. I.e. the redirect. 
 // which has the form "https://www.wikiwand.com/en/wikiwand"
	window.location.href = "https://www.wikiwand.com/" + lang + "/" + article;
}
```
